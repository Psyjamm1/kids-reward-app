# 🚀 FIXED Netlify Deployment

## ✅ This Version Works!

This is a single-file deployment that fixes the "exports is not defined" error.

## 📦 What's Inside:

- **index.html** - Complete app in one file (all code embedded)
- **netlify.toml** - Netlify configuration

## 🎯 How to Deploy:

1. **Delete your old deployment** in Netlify (or just deploy this as a new site)
2. **Drag this `netlify-fixed` folder** to Netlify
3. Wait 30 seconds
4. **It will work!** ✅

## 🔧 What Was Fixed:

- ❌ **OLD:** Separate app.js file with module exports (caused error)
- ✅ **NEW:** Everything in one HTML file (works perfectly)

## ⚡ Deploy Now:

Just drag this entire folder to Netlify and you're done!

Your app will load immediately! 🎉
